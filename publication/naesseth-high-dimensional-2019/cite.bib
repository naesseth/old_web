 abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods comprise one of the most successful approaches to approximate Bayesian filtering. However, SMC without a good proposal distribution can perform poorly, in particular in high dimensions. We propose nested sequential Monte Carlo, a methodology that generalizes the SMC framework by requiring only approximate, properly weighted, samples from the SMC proposal distribution, while still resulting in a correct SMC algorithm. This way, we can compute an “exact approximation” of, e.g., the locally optimal proposal, and extend the class of models for which we can perform efficient inference using SMC. We show improved accuracy over other state-of-the-art methods on several spatio-temporal state-space models.},
