VI posits a family of approximating distributions q and then finds the member of that family that is closest to the exact posterior p. Traditionally, VI algorithms minimize the “exclusive Kullback-Leibler (KL)” KL(q||p), often for computational convenience. Recent research, however, has also focused on the “inclusive KL” KL(p||q), which has good statistical properties that makes it more appropriate for certain inference problems. This paper develops a simple algorithm for reliably minimizing the inclusive KL using stochastic gradients with vanishing bias. This method, which we call Markovian score climbing (MSC), converges to a local optimum of the inclusive KL. It does not suffer from the systematic errors inherent in existing methods, such as Reweighted Wake-Sleep and Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo, which lead to bias in their final estimates. We illustrate convergence on a toy model and demonstrate the utility of MSC on Bayesian probit regression for classification as well as a stochastic volatility model for financial data.","tags":[],"title":"Markovian Score Climbing: Variational Inference with KL(p||q)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian A.

However, SMC without a good proposal distribution can perform poorly, in particular in high dimensions. We propose nested sequential Monte Carlo, a methodology that generalizes the SMC framework by requiring only approximate, properly weighted, samples from the SMC proposal distribution, while still resulting in a correct SMC algorithm. This way, we can compute an “exact approximation” of, e.g., the locally optimal proposal, and extend the class of models for which we can perform efficient inference using SMC.

The systems we design, and technology we develop, requires us to coherently represent and work with uncertainty in data. Probabilistic models and probabilistic inference gives us a powerful framework for solving this problem. Using this framework, while enticing, results in difficult-to-compute integrals and probabilities when conditioning on the observed data. This means we have a need for approximate inference, methods that solves the problem approximately using a systematic approach. In this thesis we develop new methods for efficient approximate inference in probabilistic models.\nThere are generally two approaches to approximate inference, variational methods and Monte Carlo methods. In Monte Carlo methods we use a large number of random samples to approximate the integral of interest. With variational methods, on the other hand, we turn the integration problem into that of an optimization problem. We develop algorithms of both types and bridge the gap between them.\nFirst, we present a self-contained tutorial to the popular sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) class of methods. Next, we propose new algorithms and applications based on SMC for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models. We derive nested sequential Monte Carlo, a new algorithm particularly well suited for inference in a large class of high-dimensional probabilistic models. Then, inspired by similar ideas we derive interacting particle Markov chain Monte Carlo to make use of parallelization to speed up approximate inference for universal probabilistic programming languages. After that, we show how we can make use of the rejection sampling process when generating gamma distributed random variables to speed up variational inference. Finally, we bridge the gap between SMC and variational methods by developing variational sequential Monte Carlo, a new flexible family of variational approximations.","tags":[],"title":"Machine learning using approximate inference : Variational and sequential Monte Carlo methods","type":"publication"}]
